  <h1>Landmark Essay</h1>
  <h2>Throughout the time that I've Spent in NYC, I've ended up enjoying its character and unique composition. I've learned to enjoy certain neighbourhoods and areas as well. Here is a short essay that I've written about one of my favorite places in the city, the Pier 40 Bike Lane</h2>
  <h3> When somebody thinks of  a bike lane they would most likely think of a path through a trail, or perhaps a painted off section of a street. For New Yorkers, they would almost certainly choose the latter of those options. One example of a monumental bike lane is  the Pier 40 bike lane, by the West Side Highway. The landmark would almost certainly  change one’s previous perception of what could possibly be a sweaty, bland, and dainty place, and into a vision that portrays?pertains more beauty, essentially having its own community as a result of its differences. ThisSaid altered view is best interpreted when accounting for the many subdivisions of people who roam the area.

Pier 40 to most is essentially just a place where that boats can dock that’s around a large soccer field. Next to Pier 40 is a line of asphalt that made its mark as a staple of the Wwest Sside Hhighway. Whether for the views or for the place to work out, the lane attracts people. The biking area has also had its own effects on the people inhabiting the vicinity. The long line of road being consistently used has made a community where athletes and civilians can coexist.

If you haven’t been to the lane, you might think that  it’s strictly reserved to people biking, or pedestrians finding their way to the Hudson River. In fact, there is so much more to it. Groups of people synchronously congregate to and from, whether they are on bikes,  skateboards,  rollerblades, and scooters. The place has life that is represented by these  people. You’ll see the skaters sitting on benches drinking Arizonas or flashing by, bikers preparing for their next race, or even possibly track runners training for a marathon that they might have in the near future. This may cause some people to believe this landmark could possibly be claustrophobic, which is evident considering the many different groups. Yet, this bike lane has a place for everyone. The groups are fine with sharing the place no matter what the hustle is. This allows everyone to have an experience on the lane

On a regular day in the summer, you would see a beautiful path of lush trees, clean benches, nicely paved strips of asphalt, and paint that isn’t scraped off the road. You’d also see working water fountains, newly paved basketball/tennis courts, and the beautiful sight of the Sstatue of Lliberty. This is where pedestrians and families commonly spend their time, whilst the bike lakers share different experiences. When comparing this to other street bike lanes a huge amount of contrast can be easily concluded. The bike lane makes it easy for people to enjoy the view after their workouts, and enjoy the crisp air as they re-energize to keep going. When looking at the water around evening you’ll see a beautiful sunset cascade across the sky, which  makes it a beautiful place to end a long day of walking at. The first time I went to the lane seeing the gorgeous sunset made me realize that Pier 40 was more than just a stadium and a bike lane, it’s an epicenter of urban beauty.

Overall, the Pier 40 bike lane might feel bland to some, however. To me it's a place where life can thrive, and people can do what they want. To me it's a place where memories can be made, and  where people can exercise and move at their own paces.
